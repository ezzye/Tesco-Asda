Sorting Tesco and Asda Data

Create a process which solves parts A and B below; and then answer part C. Document your work using either a flowchart, pseudo-code, a written sequence of steps, or a programming language you are familiar with. The table below is example data, but your solution should be generic and hence applicable to any data supplied in this format. 

A. Identify which pairs of rows have identical Products, Customers and Measures, and overlapping date ranges; e.g., as per rows 1 and 2. 

B. Of the rows identified in part A, update the rows to make the date ranges not overlap. 

C. Document any assumptions or decisions you needed to make for your solution.

Data has the following colums:

Row ID
Product
Customer
Measure
Value
Valid From Day
Valid To Day

For A - concatenate info and match and then use below for overlap.

Remove overlap so that any period shows maximum cost or minimum price to be prudent.

For C assume that data is financial data so needs to be treated as such.

Also assume that widgets are fungible and so cannot be tracked.

The sale price and distribution cost are set for different number of units so are not comparable.
